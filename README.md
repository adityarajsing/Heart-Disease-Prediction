# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and its incidence is increasing. Analyzing heart disease involves examining risk factors, signs and symptoms, diagnostic tests, and treatment options. Risk factors for heart disease include age, gender, family history, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, and physical inactivity. Diagnostic tests for heart disease may include blood tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), stress tests, echocardiograms, cardiac catheterization, and others. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medications, and surgical procedures. Understanding 
and analyzing heart disease is essential for developing effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies. In this context, a diabetes prediction ML model can be a valuable tool for healthcare providers to identify individuals who are at risk of developing diabetes and provide timely interventions to prevent or manage the disease. Such a model can also help patients make informed decisions about their health and lifestyle choices
